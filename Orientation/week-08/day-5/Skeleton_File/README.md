# **Skeleton files for all the initializers so far**


* Files in here:
    * main\.c
        > should be in _src_ folder<\br>
        > only includes _initializers\.h_<\br>
        > only calls _init\_ALL\(\);_<\br>
    
    * initializers\.h
        > should be in _inc_ folder<\br>
        > contains all the global variables \(handles\)<\br>
        > contains all the declarations of the functions<\br>
    
    * initializers\.c
        > should be in _src_ folder<\br>
        > contains all the function definitions<\br>
        > **Always edit the _init\_ALL\(\);_ function, by uncommenting the needed initializer functions\!**<\br>
