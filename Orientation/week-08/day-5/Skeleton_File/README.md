# **Skeleton files for all the initializers so far**


* Files in here:
    * main\.c
        > should be in _src_ folder  
        > only includes _initializers\.h_  
        > only calls _init\_ALL\(\);_  
    
    * initializers\.h
        > should be in _inc_ folder  
        > contains all the global variables \(handles\)  
        > contains all the declarations of the functions  
    
    * initializers\.c
        > should be in _src_ folder  
        > contains all the function definitions  
        > **Always edit the _init\_ALL\(\);_ function, by uncommenting the needed initializer functions\!**  
        
    * vector\.h
        > should be in _inc_ folder  
        > header of C\-implemented vector \"class\"  
        
    * vector\.c
        > should be in _src_ folder  
        > source file of C\-implemented vector \"class\"
