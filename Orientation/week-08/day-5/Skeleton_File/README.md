* Files in here:
    * main\.c
        > should be in _src_ folder <\br>
        > only includes _initializers\.h_ <\br>
        > only calls _init\_ALL\(\);_ <\br>
    
    * initializers\.h
        > should be in _inc_ folder<\br>
        > contains all the global variables \(handles\) <\br>
        > contains all the declarations of the functions <\br>
    
    * initializers\.c
        > should be in _src_ folder <\br>
        > contains all the function definitions <\br>
        > **Always edit the _init\_ALL\(\);_ function, by uncommenting the needed initializer functions\!** <\br>
